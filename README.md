## Neighborhood Map

### Objective

this project for learning how we can  design patterns and UI libraries like React assist in developing a manageable codebase.
and how the frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a
number of utilities for you to use.




## Project Requirement Specifications

### Interface Design


| Criteria                            | Specifications                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Responsiveness                       |All application components render on-screen in a responsive manner.                     |
|Usability                            |All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.|


### Application Functionality

| Criteria           | Specifications                       |
| -------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Location Filter     |Includes a text input field and list filters the map markers and list items to locations matching with selection|
|List View           |A list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered subset of locations when a filter is applied.|
|Map and Markers     |Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied|


### Application Architecture


| Criteria                                                            | Specifications                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Proper Use of React| React code follows a reasonable component structure. -There are at least 5 locations in the model. These may be hard-coded or retrieved from a data API.|

 ##  Package MediaWiki:

* [MediaWiki:](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) It is a web service that provides convenient access to wiki features, data, and meta-data over HTTP, via a URL usually at api.php.
